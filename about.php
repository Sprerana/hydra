Groundwater, which is in aquifers below the surface of the Earth, is one of the Nation's most important natural resources. Groundwater is the source of about 33 percent of the water that county and city water departments supply to households and businesses (public supply). It provides drinking water for more than 90 percent of the rural population who do not get their water delivered to them from a county/city water department or private water company. Even some major cities, such as San Antonio, Texas, rely solely on groundwater for all their needs. About 42 percent of the water used for irrigation comes from groundwater. Withdrawals of groundwater are expected to rise as the population increases and available sites for surface reservoirs become more limited.<br></p>

<br>
<br>
<ul style="margin-left: 4%;font-size: 20px; color:white;">
<li>The Ground Water Guardian is regulating withdrawal of ground water by industries/ projects . List of these critical areas has been mentioned in tabular as well as graphical form</li>
<li>Govt can notify 162 critical/ overexploited areas in parts of NCT Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, MP, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UT of Puducherry and UT of Diu for control and regulation of development of ground water resources. Email alerts are to be generated time to time to have balance the consumption and recharge.</li>
<li>IOT devices like the sensors are used to measure the ground water levels.So this applicaion is extended to companies building these IOT devices to get real time information or data of the ground water levels with pictorial analysis.</li>
</ul>

<span style="margin-left: 3%;font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> Ground Water Legislation :</span>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;font-size: 20px;color:white">
It is the social responsibility of the industries to parallely recharge the ground water through artificial means or otherwise while consuming water for their purposes.
This application used by large organisations to regulate the pumps also have a responsibilty to conserve water.
As many organisatons consider this pressing problem and implement it a big  change can be seen.</p>
